# Hypercurve for Faust

The CMakeLists.txt file will generate a header only file that will later be included in the faustlibrary. In order to do that, you need to have [Quom](https://github.com/Viatorus/quom) installed.

The Faust build basically consists of two steps : 

* Generate a header only hypercurve_faust.h that contains all hypercurve. 
* Move hypercurve.lib and hypercurve_faust.h to the build directory. 

Then, you can copy these two files to your Faust library directory.
